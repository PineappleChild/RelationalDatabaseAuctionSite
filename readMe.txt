deleteName()

    The method returns the rendered selected form choice(eg: addPatientName or deletePatientName)

add_name()
    This method adds a new first and last name combination to the database
    It tries to ensure that the PID(generated by the generatePID(method)) is unique though the PRIMARY KEY keyword
    The method also loads non-duplicate entries though the DISTINCT keyword and groups duplicate entries by their PID through the GROUP BY keyword
    The method returns the database entries based on the above conditions

delete_name()
    This method deleted a first and last name combination by checking the PID
    It takes in a first name and last name inorder to generate a PID which is unique for a first and last name combination

generatePID()
    This method takes in a first and last name

    The method concatenates the input parameters and removes the leading and trailing spaces from each input
    The method then sets the concatenated inputs to uppercase to prevent duplicates from case changes
    The method then uses the python built in hash method to generate a unique integer from the treated concatenated input string and sets it to its absolute value
    inorder to prevent negative PID values
    The method returns a unique PID value for a first and last name combination

homePage.html
    the page uses a form drop down to allow the user to select either the add patient name page or the delete patient name page
    the form is submitted though a button
    the page is light blue since it looks nice and has a health care look
    the page is left justified since it looks nice and professional, it also groups all the information to reduce the users need to move their eyes too much

addPatientName.html
    the page has a bold title so that the user understands what to input into the fields
    the button is green since it has a positive association correlating to adding something to another thing
    the page is light blue to follow the homePage theme, and it gives the site a health care look similar to Sutter-Health
    the enter page form has a rounded blue border for aesthetic purposes, also having a filled border looks
    bad with the form inputs being white(there is too much contrast)

deletePatientName.html
    the page has a bold title to instruct the user what to do in the page
    each field is labeled with the information that the user should enter to prevent confusion
    the button is red since it has an association to removing something(eg: deleting a first and last name from the database)
    When the user clicks on the delete button a modal pops up asking the user if they are sure they want to delete the entry in the form
        The modal code was referenced from the bootstrap modal page with changes to reflect the content of the site
            (eg: "Are you sure you want to delete the patient entry?"
            The modal follows the theme of the rest of the site though a blue theme
            The borders are rounded for visual purposes and it has some padding to help with the formatting of the modal
    the page has a light blue theme so that it appears like a health care site and so it follows the theme of the rest of the page
    the enter page form utilizes a rounded blue border since it looks nice, and having a
    filled border looks bad with the form inputs being white(there is too much contrast)
